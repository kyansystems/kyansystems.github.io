      <description>Kyan Systems is a worker-owned cooperative building software and hardware solutions for a fundamentally new vision of the internet. Founded in 2020, we are committed to a fair, equitable, and functional vision of software and hardware solutions that do not rely on exploitative unpaid labor, ruinous per-call streaming usage models, or inserting middlemen to act as toll booths or increase complexity at the cost of security.
We ask ourselves: what would really good basics look like?</description>
