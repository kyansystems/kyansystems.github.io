                <p>Kyan Systems is a worker-owned cooperative building software and hardware solutions for a fundamentally new vision of the internet. Founded in 2020, we are committed to a fair, equitable, and functional vision of software and hardware solutions that do not rely on exploitative unpaid labor, ruinous per-call streaming usage models, or inserting middlemen to act as toll booths or increase complexity at the cost of security.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves: what would really good basics look like? Why is it necessary for the majority of non-technical users of technology to use something like email to get a document to the correct printer or viewer? Why do media files for home and personal use - which have already been purchased and paid for - continually have to be re-created so they can be played in a new walled garden? Why can&rsquo;t a user&rsquo;s personal device be used as a universal terminal with other networks, instead of an infinitely expanding series of unique (and insecure) systems that each need their own security and data sanitizing protocols in place?</p>
<p>We believe there is a better way, and we&rsquo;re building a new foundation - for everyone.</p>
