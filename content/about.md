Kyan Systems is a worker-owned cooperative building software and hardware solutions for a fundamentally new vision of the internet. Founded in 2020, we are committed to a fair, equitable, and functional vision of software and hardware solutions that do not rely on exploitative unpaid labor, ruinous per-call streaming usage models, or inserting middlemen to act as toll booths or increase complexity at the cost of security. 

We ask ourselves: what would really good basics look like? Why is it necessary for the majority of non-technical users of technology to use something like email to get a document to the correct printer or viewer? Why do media files for home and personal use - which have already been purchased and paid for - continually have to be re-created so they can be played in a new walled garden? Why can't a user's personal device be used as a universal terminal with other networks, instead of an infinitely expanding series of unique (and insecure) systems that each need their own security and data sanitizing protocols in place?

We believe there is a better way, and we're building a new foundation - for everyone.
